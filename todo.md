# Pyclass Todo List

1. 7Feb2022: Move more of the early sessions to Google Colab. Don't have students install Python until later.
2. 7Feb2022: Add a tutorial specifically for Github.
3. 7Feb2022: In session 6 on functions, multiple students are missing the distinction between returning the result and printing the result from a function. Modify the session so they are forced to return a result. May run the function they write and use the return value for something.
5. 7Feb2022: I've seen the `if my_boolean_var == True` trope several times. Need to warn students about that.
