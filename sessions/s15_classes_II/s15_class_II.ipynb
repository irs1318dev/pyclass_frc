    "In the game *Ten Thousand*, each die roll of 1 is worth 100 points and each roll of 5 is worth 50 points. It would be useful to be able to see how many ones or fives are in each roll of the dice. There are a few ways to do this:\n",
    "* We could used the `Dice._counts` property. If our `Dice` object is named `my_dice`, then the expression `my_dice._counts[1]` would get the number of rolls showing 1, and `my_dice._counts[5]` would get the number of rolls showing 5. \n",
    "* We could also create methods like `my_dice.get_ones()` and `my_dice.get_fives()`. The advantage of using methods is that we don't have to remember how the `._counts` ditionary works. Also, if we decide to replace `._counts` with some other data structure down the road, we can modify the `.get_ones()` and `.get_fives()` methods and other programs that use the `Dice` class need updating.\n",
    "* We could create attributes, so you would be able to get the number of ones and fives with the expressions `my_dice.ones` and `my_dice.fives`. This syntax is short and intuitive. The problem is that the number of ones and fives will change if we re-roll the dice. We would have to remember to update the attributes every time we re-rolled the dice. If we forgot, we would have a bug in our program.\n",

    "### D. Encapsulation\n",
    "#### Definition\n",
    "The `@property` and `@x.setter` decorators are examples of encapsulation. Encapsulation refers to hiding the internal details of an object from the other classes or functions that use that object. The `Dice._counts` dictionary, which stores the number of dice that have each value (1 - 6) is an example of an internal detail. We don't need to know anything about the `._counts` dictionary to use a `Dice` object. Suppose we replaceed the `._counts` dictionary with a list or some other type of data structure. As long as we update the `Dice.ones`, `Dice.fives` and `Dice.score` properties to use the new data structure, we won't have to change any code outside the `Dice` class. Two benefits of encapsulation are that it makes our code easier to update and it helps prevent bugs.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Name Mangling\n",
    "There is nothing that prevents a user of the `Dice` class from directly accessing the `._counts()` attribute . Starting attribute names with an underscore is a naming convention that indicates the property or method name is for internal use only, but programmers are free to ignore it. Python provides a feature called *name mangling* to make it less likely that a programmer will access a class's private attributes. \n",
    "\n",
    "If an attribute or method name starts with *two* underscores, and at most one trailing underscore, Python replaces the name of the attribute with `._ClassName__methodname`. Within the class definition, attributes with two leading underscores can be accessed with no special requirements. Name mangling occurs only when trying to access the attribute from outside the class definition. Run the cell below to see an example."

    "### A. `RollableDice` Class\n",
    "Before we discuss inheritance specifically, let's take another look at the `Dice` class from the Ten Thousand game. Did you notice that the `Dice` class does not have a `roll()` method? Each `Die` object has its own `roll()` method, but there is no easy way to re-roll all of the `Dice` object's dice at once. There is a reason for this. In the game Ten Thousand, once dice are tabled they are never re-rolled. The developer of the Ten Thousand game wanted didn't want to accidentally change dice once they were tabled, so he created a `Dice()` class that didn't have a `roll()` method, or any other method that would change the value of the tabled dice. Another aspect of the `Dice` class is that we can add a die to a `Dice` object (see `add_dice()`) but there is no method for removing a die.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, non-tabled dice are re-rolled in Ten Thousand. We need another composite class that can hold `Die` objects that allows the dice to be re-rolled. We also need to be able to remove one or more dice from the set of non-tabled dice when we table dice. The `RollableDice` class, defined below, accomplishes both objectives.

    "### B. Inheritance Defined\n",
    "The answer is in the very first line of the class definition: `RollableDice(Dice):`. Up until now, the parentheses at the end of the `class` statement have been empty. But here we are placing the `Dice` class within the parentheses. This tells Python that we want the `RollableDice` class to *inherit* from the `Dice` class. In this example, `Dice` is the *parent* class and `RollableDice` is the *child* class. A child class inherits the methods and properties of its parent class. For example, when accessed the `ones` property on the `RollableDice` object, Python looked for a `ones` attribute in `RollableDice` but didn't find one. Next, Python looked for and found a `ones` attribute in the parent class, `Dice`.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this example, there are only two generations in out class structure, the parent and child. But we could easily create a new class that inherits form `RollableDice`, like `ExplodingDice`, where the dice explode and set your table on fire if anyone rolls all sixes. And we could create yet another class that inherits from `ExplodingDice`, and so on. Any class can use any method or attribute that is defined in the class or any of its ancestor classes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Inheritance provides several benefits.\n",
    "1. It reduces the amount of code we need to write. For `RollableDice`, we needed to define only two methods, `roll()` and `remove_dice()`.\n",
    "2. It makes code easier to maintain. For example, if we wanted to change the rules for calculating the score, we only need to modify one `score(0` method to update both classes.\n",
    "3. It makes code easier to think about. The relationship between `Dice` and `RollableDice` reflects real life. For example, all `RollableDice` are `Dice` but not all `Dice` are `RollableDice`."

    "### C. Calling Parent's `__init__()` with `super()`\n",

    "If we had not included an `__init__()` method in the `RollableDice` class, what would happen if we tried to create a new `RollableDice` object (i.e., `rdice = RollableDice()`?\n",
    "\n",
    "If you guessed that the parent class's `__init__()` class would have been called, you are correct. So there are at least two different ways to initialize a class that descends from another class:\n",
    "1. Omit the `__init__()` method, which will cause the parent's `__init__()` method to be called.\n",
    "2. Include an `__init__()` method, which will cause the child class's `__init__()` method to be called instead of the parent's `__init__()` method. In this case, the parent's `__init__()` method will not run at all.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a third scenario. The parent class's `__init__()` method sometimes does useful stuff. A common scenario for when a class is instantiated is that we want everything defined in the parent's `__init__()` to happen, plus we want additional child-class code to run. We could copy statements from the parent class's `__init__()` method to the child class's `__init__()` method, but that would be a disaster waiting to happen. It's likely that we would forget to update the child class when making changes to the parent class's `__init__()` method. It also would violate the DRY principle, *do not repeat yourself*. The best option is to call the parent class's `__init__()` method from within the child class's `__init__()` method.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can call the parent class's `__init__()` method with the statement `super().__init__()`, which is the first line in `RollableDice`'s `__init__()` method. `super()` is a built-in Python function that returns a modified `RollableDice` object, where all methods come from `RollableDice`'s parent class, regardless of whether the methods have been overridden in `RollableDice`. So when initializing `RollableDice`, we first call `Dice`'s `__init__()` method, then we automatically add `Die` objects to `RollableDice`."

You don't need to watch the entire video -- everything you need to know is in the first 45 seconds or so. Add an optional parameter to your `cut()` method that specifies the location at which the deck will be cut. The parameter is a non-negative integer. If 0, the deck remains unchanged. If 1, the top card is moved to the bottom. If 2, the top two cards are moved to the bottom, and etc. If this parameter is missing, then the cut position is chosen randomly."

    "## VII. Polymorphism\n",
    "We've practiced using composition, inheritance, and encapsulation, but we have not yet discussed polymorphism. Polymorphism refers to using a single interface for objects of different types. We used polymorphism in our `Rook` and `Knight` classes. Both objects have the same interface consisting of `.get_moves()` and `.can_jump` attributes, but have different rules for how they move on the board. Consquently, the `Board` class doesn't have to concern itself with the rules for how a piece moves. A `Board` object can call one of its pieces `.get_moves()` methods no matter what type of chess piece it is. There are different types of polymorphism - the type we used is called subtype polymorphism."
