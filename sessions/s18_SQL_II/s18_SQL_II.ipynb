    "# FRC Analytics with Python - Session 17\n",
    "# Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL) - Part I\n",
    "**Last Updated: 8 October 2021**\n",
    "\n",
    "This session covers *Structured Query Language* (SQL). SQL is used to to create, modify, and retrieve data stored in relational databases. SQL has been in general use since the 1980s and is required knowledge for data scientists and business analysts. SQL is included in our curriculum because the Issaquah Robotics Society's scouting system uses SQL to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *database* is a software program that stores information. Relational databases are a type of database that store data in tables with rows and columns. Databases often run on computer servers and provide information to other computer programs over a network. For example, when a web browser retrieves a web page, the web page is generated by a web server like Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), or Nginx. Web servers typically retrieve data from relational database servers when they construct a web page. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle are some of the most common relational database servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IRS's scouting system uses a simple relational database called *SQLite*. Sqlite is bundeled with Python, so if you've installed Python on your computer, you already have Sqlite.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### SQL References\n",
    "* The [W3 Schools SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/default.asp)  The W3 tutorial covers basic SQL syntax that is common to popular database systems.  It includes simple examples and it's great for when you know what type of query you need, but can't remember the exact syntax. This notebook contains links to applicable sections of the W3 SQL tutoral.\n",
    "* Although basic SQL syntax is the same on different database systems, there are differences in how they support advanced SQL features. [The official *SQLite* documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) provides precise descriptions of the features supported by *SQLite*.\n",
    "* This notebook uses the *sqlite3* package from the *Python Standard Library* to interact with *SQLite* databases.  [The package's documenetation is available here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) Keep in mind that *SQLite* can be used with many programming langauges, including Java, Python, C/C++, R, Javascript, Scala, Julia, and Ruby. Each of these languages has its own library for interacting with *SQLite* databases."

Literal text values should always be surrounded by *single* quotes. (*Sqlite* will let you use double quotes around literal strings, but other common database servers, like *Postgres*, will not. It's best get in the habit of using single quotes in this situation.)\n",

For example, if we change our the second part of our `WHERE` clause to `AND city = 'seattle'`, our search will return no results (try it for yourself!) because all occurrences of 'Seattle' in the *teams* table are capitalized. *Sqlite* queries can be forced to conduct a case-insensitive search by adding `COLLATE NOCASE` to the end of the `WHERE` clause. Also, it's possible to specify that searches should be case-insensitive when creating a database table.\n",

    "Unlike Python, SQL is case insensitive. SQL considers the queries `SELECT * FROM teams;` and `select * frOM TEAMS;` to be identical. This means you can't have two tables where the only differences in the table names are that some characters are upper or lower case.\n",

    "* User-generated table and column names will always be all lowercase.\n",
    "* If table or column names contain multiple words, the words will be separated by underscores.\n",
    "* Longer queries will be placed on multiple lines, with the leftmost keywords right-aligned.\n",
    "* Table names will be a plural noun that describes the data stored in the table.\n",

    "In addition, when writing SQL queries in Python code, the mentor recommends placing SQL queries in triple-quoted strings. This practice has two advantages:\n",
    "* It allows multi-line queries, which enhances readability.\n",

    "* The `sqlite3.connection.execute()` method\n",
    "* *Sqlite3's* `cursor` object.\n",
    "\n",
    "We've seen examples of the first two techniques. We'll use the `cursor` object later in this section. We'll also cover how to execute SQL queries in *SQLite* from the command line.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. The `pandas.read_sql_query()` Function\n",
    "We've used the `read_sql_query()` function from the *Pandas* package to execute all of our queries. The `read_sql_query()` function is not part of the SQL specification. It is a function provided by the *Pandas* package that makes it easy to get data from a SQL database into a dataframe. We're using `read_sql_query()` function in this notebook because displaying the query results as *Pandas* dataframes makes the easy to read.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpful Hint:** *Pandas* SQL functions require that the *SQLAlchemy* package be installed. Installing *Pandas* does not automatically install *SQLAlchemy*. If you get an error the first time you run a *Pandas* SQL function, install *SQLAlchemy* if it isn't installed. The CLI commands `conda list sqlachemy` and `conda install sqlalchemy` should do the trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read_sql_query()` function has two required parameters and six optional ones. We've used three of the parameters so far.\n",
    "* `sql`: A text string containing the SQL query we want to execute.\n",
    "* `con`: A *Sqlite* database connection object. Without the connection object, Pandas would have no clue which database we want to use.\n",
    "* `index_col`: *Pandas* dataframes always have an index column that is displayed on the left side of the dataframe. If the use doesn't specify an index, *Pandas* will create an integer index starting at zero. The `index_col` parameter allows us to tell *Pandas* to use one of the table's columns as an index. This prevents *Pandas* from displaying an extraneous column of integers that don't exist in the underlying database.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Refer to the official *Pandas* documentation for more information on the `read_sql_query()` function.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_sql_query.html#pandas.read_sql_query).\n"

    "### B. The `connection.execute()` Method\n",
    "The `pandas.read_sql_query()` function only works if the query returns data. For other queries, use the `execute()` method from the `sqlite3` package. Here is an example:\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Import the sqlite3 package\n",
    "import sqlite3\n",
    "\n",
    "# Get a connection object to the database file\n",
    "con = sqlite3.connect(\"database-file.sqlite3\")\n",
    "\n",
    "# Create and execute the query\n",
    "query \"\"\"UPDATE some_table\n",
    "            SET some_column = 'some_value'\n",
    "            WHERE some_other_column = 'some_other_value';\"\"\"\n",
    "con.execute(query)\n",
    "\n",
    "# Commit the changes\n",
    "con.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This is mostly straightforward. We just run the `execute()` method on the connection object, passing the SQL query as an argument.\n",
    "\n",
    "The only mysterious part of the code snippet is the line `con.commit()`. If we were to omit this line, the changes would not be saved to the database. It's as if the `commit()` function is really the `simon_says()` function. If we don't say *Simon Says...*, nothing actually happens.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `commit()` function seems superflous but it exists for a very good reason. Suppose you have a savings and a checking account at a local bank. The bank stores account records in a SQL database. They have a *account_balances* table that contains the account balance of every account.\n",
    "* Now suppose that you try to transfer &dollar;100 from your checking account to your savings account.\n",
    "* This transfer requires two `UPDATE` queries. The first `UPDATE` query subtracts &dollar;100 from your checking account balance. The second query adds &dollar;100 to your savings account balance.\n",
    "* Suppose the first query, which decrements your checking account balance by &dollar;100, runs just fine. But then there is a glitch, and the second `UPDATE` query throws an error and doesn't run.\n",
    "* You have just lost &dollar;100. &dollar;100 was subtracted from your checking account, but there was no corresponding increase in your savings account balance. That's bad.\n",
    "\n",
    "We want both queries to run with no errors. But if one query fails, it would be best if none of the queries run. Most of us would prefer that the transfer not happen at all over having &dollar;100 mysteriously dissapear from our checking account. The `commit()` function exists for this purpose. Consider the following code.\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "subtract_query = \"\"\"\n",
    "    UPDATE balances\n",
    "       SET balance = balance - 100\n",
    "     WHERE user_id = '9876543'\n",
    "       AND account = 'checking';\"\"\"\n",
    "       \n",
    "add_query = \"\"\"\n",
    "    UPDATE balances\n",
    "       SET balance = balance + 100\n",
    "     WHERE user_id = '9876543'\n",
    "       AND account = 'savings';\"\"\"\n",
    "       \n",
    "con.execute(subtract_query)\n",
    "con.execute(add_query)\n",
    "con.commit()\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "The `con.commit()` method allows us to group SQL queries together. If either the `subtract_query` or `add_query` fail, execution will stop before the `con.commit()` method is run, and no changes will be saved to the database. Another option is to catch the error and call the `con.rollback()` method, which will revert the database to the most recent commit.\n",
    "\n",
    "A group of SQL statments that must be run as a group, with either all or none of the SQL statements being executed, is called a *transaction*. It is possible to configure *SQLite* to automatically commit every SQL query without calling `con.commit()`, but we're not going to do that.\n",

    "### D. Using Cursors\n",
    "So far we've used two different techniques to run SQL queries on our *SQLite* database. We used *Pandas* `.read_sql_query()` for queries that return information and the *sqlite3* package's `.execute()` methods for queries that don't return any information. You may be wondering ... would we ever use the `.execute()` method for queries that do return information? The answer is yes, absolutely! But first, we need to learn about cursors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cursor Etymology\n",
    "You already know about two kinds of cursors. Your computer mouse's or touchpad's cursor indicates the position on the screen that will be activated if you click the mouse's or touchpad's button. Word processors, text editors, and CLIs use a cursor to indicate the position at which text will be entered if you type characters on your keyboard. The word cursor comes from the Latin word *cursor*, which means runner or courier. Before computers were commonplace, the word cursor was [frequently used to describe the transparent slide on a slide rule](https://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/sliderules/) (see figure below). A slide rule cursor moves back and forth along the slide rule and has a vertical hariline that helps the useer line up different scales on the slide rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Slide Rule](sliderule.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database Cursors\n",

It turns out there is a good reason the cursor behaves the way it does.
