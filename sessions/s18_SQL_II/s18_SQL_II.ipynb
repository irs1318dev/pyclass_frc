You would send a purchase order to *Spacely Sprockets* specifying what sprockets you wanted to purchase, when and to where they should be shipped, and the price you intended to pay for them. *Spacely Sprockets* would ship you the sprockets and then would send you an invoice, listing the products shipped to you and how much money you owed them.\n",

But it does have a *CustomerId* column containing an arbitrary-looking integer. For example, invoice #1, which was billed to someone in Germany, has a *CustomerId* of 2. The *Customer* table also has a record with a *CustomerId* of 2, and that customer, named Leonie Köhler, has an address in Stuttgart, Germany. We're using the *CustomerId* values to match records in the *Invoice* table with records in the *Customer* table.\n",

    "### B. Using Cursors\n",
    "So far we've used two different techniques to run SQL queries on our *SQLite* database. We used *Pandas* `.read_sql_query()` for queries that return information and the *sqlite3* package's `.execute()` methods for queries that don't return any information. You may be wondering ... would we ever use the `.execute()` method for queries that do return information? The answer is yes, absolutely! But first, we need to learn about cursors.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Cursor Etymology\n",
    "You already know about two kinds of cursors. Your computer mouse's cursor indicates the position on the screen that will be activated if you click the mouse's button. Word processors, text editors, and CLIs use a cursor to indicate the position at which text will be entered if you type characters on your keyboard. The word cursor comes from the Latin word *cursor*, which means runner or courier. Before computers were commonplace, the word cursor was [frequently used to describe the transparent slide on a slide rule](https://www.math.utah.edu/~alfeld/sliderules/) (see figure below). A slide rule cursor moves back and forth along the slide rule and has a vertical hariline that helps the users line up different scales on the slide rule. \n",
    "\n",
    "![Slide Rule](images/sliderule.jpg)\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Database Cursors\n",
    "In database programming, the word *cursor* has a special meaning. It refers to a software object that marks the current position within a set of database records that have been returned from a query. But enough talk -- let's look at an example."

    "No records were returned when we tried to iterate over the cursor a second time. That's because the cursor object does not contain the query results. Instead, it points to the query data in the database. Like a text cursor that indicates your current position within a document, the database cursor indicates the position within the database of the data we want to retrieve.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before the `for` loop, the cursor points to the first record of the query results. The first record is not retrieved from the database until we enter the `for` loop for the first time. On subsequent iterations of the `for` loop, the data in the `record` variable is overwritten with a new tuple containing the next record. After the final record is retrieved and the `for` loop is finished, the cursor is exhausted and points to the end of the query results.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other than re-running the query, there is no way to make the cursor move backwards and point to an earlier record or the first record. Either you save the record within the body of a `for` loop, or the record is lost forever (or until you re-run the query).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Benefits of Using Cursors\n",
    "Why would the cursor object behave like this? Why can't we just get a data-structure that contains all the records and peruse it at our convenience, in whatever order we choose? It turns out there is a good reason the cursor behaves the way it does. The following code selects all records from the *measures* table using *Pandas* and a cursor object and compares the amount of memory used.
