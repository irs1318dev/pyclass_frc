    "## I. Introduction\n",
    "Tabular data is data that is organized into rows and columns. It's everywhere -- in newspapers and magazines, on websites, in computer databases, and in Microsoft Excel files. Evaluating and manipulating tabular data is an essential skill for any analyst.\n",

    "Tabular data is often stored in comma separated value (CSV) files. CSV files are text files that use commas and newline characters (I'll explain what those are shortly) to organize the contents of the file into a table. Let's look at an example. The `space.csv` file contains information on 4,324 space launches, starting with the launch of the the Sputnik spacecraft by the Soviet Union in 1957. The dataset is available on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957). The Python code below opens the file and displays the first five lines."

A `Series` is similar to a list, but with some differences:\n",

    "Pandas provides an immense number of ways to select and extract data from a dataframe, many more than can be covered in this class. Check out the [official Pandas documentation](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/user_guide/indexing.html) to see for yourself. The Pandas documentation often refers to selecting data as *indexing*, which may seem strange at first. Think about it like this - to extract the fourth item from a list called `mylist`, we put the number 3 in square brackets: `fourth_num = mylist[3]`. The number 3 is the index position of the lists fourth element of the list. We're selecting a value from the list by passing an index to the list."

This action generates 4,234 True or False values, which Pandas returns as a `Series`. An operation that is repeated on every single element of an array-like object (e.g., list, array, Series) is called an element-wise or vectorized operation. One of the benefits of using Pandas is it is capable of many element-wise operations. Not having to write a `for` loop is convenient and makes code more concise. Also, element-wise operations are often faster than operations that use `for` loops.\n",

    "#### 3. Reason for Having Indexes - The `.loc()` Method\n",
    "Why do Pandas dataframes have an index? The size of a Pandas dataframe is limited only by the amount of memory on your computer.  Pandas dataframes can have millions of rows -- that's not hyperbole. The designers of Pandas wanted to be able to extract data from dataframes quickly, regardless of the size of the dataframe. The `Index` objects make that possible. If we extract data using index values and column names, we can extract data just as quickly from large datasets as we can from small datasets.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a caveat. For indexing (i.e., extracting data) to be fast on large dataframes, each row and column must have a unique index value. Pandas will allow duplicate index values, but some operations will be slower, and there could be other problems. The best practice is to ensure each row and column has a unique index value. Your choice of index will depend on the data and how you want to use it."
