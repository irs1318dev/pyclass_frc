    "First, in line 1, we called the `open()` function and the first paramter was a file name, `\"hopper.txt\"`. As written, with just the file name, the `open()` function will expect the *hopper.txt* file to be located in the same folder as this notebook. If *hopper.txt* were located in some other folder, `open()` would throw an error. There are several ways to tell `open()` to look in different folders.\n",
    "\n",
    "* **Relative Path to Subfolder:** Referring to files in subfolders of the current folder is easy. Just prepend the folder name and a forward slash to the file name. For example, if *hopper.txt* was in a subfolder called *text_files*, we would pass this value to `open()`: *`\"text_files/hopper.txt\"`*\n",
    "* **Relative Path to Parent Folder:** Adding two periods (*`..`*) to the path tells Python to go to up one folder. For example, if *hopper.txt* was located in the parent folder of this notebook, we would pass *`\"../hopper.txt\"`* to `open()`. If *hopper.txt* was two folders up, we would pass *`\"../../hopper.txt\"`*.\n",
    "* **Relative Paths to Sibling Folders:** The techniques in the previous two examples can be combined to get to a sibling folder. For example, *`\"../brilliant_computer_scientists/hopper.txt\"`* will jump up to a parent folder and then down to a sibling folder called *brilliant_computer_scientists*.\n",
    "* **Absolute Paths:** An absolute path, starting with the root folder, can refer to any file on the computer. For example, *`\"C:/Users/stacy/Projects/pyclass_frc/sessions/s10_comprehensions_and_files/hopper.txt\"`* is an absolute path on a Windows computer.  On a linux system the path might look like *`\"/home/Users/stacy/Projects/pyclass_frc/sessions/s10_comprehensions_and_files/hopper.txt\"`* and on an apple computer it might look like *`\"/Users/stacy/Projects/pyclass_frc/sessions/s10_comprehensions_and_files/hopper.txt\"`*\n",

Microsoft Windows, on the other hand, uses two characters, a carriage return character ('\\r') and a line feed character ('\\n') to mark the end of a line. That's why, when you push files to a Github repository from Windows, you see all those messages about the end of line characters on the screen. Git is automatically converting your text files from using Windows style \"\\r\\n\" sequences to Linux style \"\\n\" sequences. And if it's not confusing enough that Windows and Linux use different characters to mark the end of a line, consider that old Apple Macintosh operating systems used just a carriage return ('\\r') to mark the end of a line.\n",

    "The user would type commands on the teletype, seeing what they typed on a sheet of paper. They would hit a key to send the command to a computer, and the output from the command would print out on the paper. The command line interface that we are currently using is an on-screen version of the old teletype interface. The print head would move left to right across the page and the paper would be moved up and down by the roller. To start typing a new line, the user would hit the *RE-TURN* key to move the print head back to the left side of the page, and the *LINE FEED* key to move the paper up one row, effectively moving the print head down to the beginning of the next line.\n",

    "So why does Windows use '\\r\\n' line endings while Linux uses just '\\n'? Microsoft Windows uses '\\r\\n' because Microsoft's earlier operating system, MS-DOS, used '\\r\\n'. MS-DOS used '\\r\\n' because back in about 1980 when MS-DOS was being developed, they wanted MS-DOS to be compatible with another popular micro-computer operating system called CP/M, which had been developed in 1974 at a company called Digital Equipment Corporation. CP/M used '\\r\\n' because that sequence worked better for sending text to teletype machines like the ASR-33 teletype pictured above.\n",

    "Linux doesn't use '\\r\\n' because Linux was designed to be compatible with an older operating system called Unix (Bell Labs, 1969), which itself was inspired by an even older operating system called MULTICS (Cooperattive project of MIT, Bel Labs, and General Electric, 1964). MULTICS used a device driver to communicate with the teletype (very innovative at the time). So text files could contain the simpler '\\n' line ending and the device driver would convert '\\n' to whatever sequence of characters the teletype needed to advance to the next line.\n",
    "\n",
    "So there you have it. Windows uses '\\r\\n' because the developers of CP/M  in 1974 didn't use a device driver to talk to teletype machines. This might have been due to CP/M being a single-tasking operating system designed to work on small computers with 8-bit processors and no more than 64 kilobytes of memory. I'm guessing there was not a lot of extra bandwidth to be running a device driver. MULTICS, on the other hand, was designed to run on more powerful mainframe computers, like the GE-600 series.\n",
