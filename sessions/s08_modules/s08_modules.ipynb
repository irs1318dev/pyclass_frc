Think about it -- if all of the code for our Python program were in some 100-page Python file, it would be difficult to find the code that we want to work on. It would also be difficult for multiple programmers to work on the program because they would all be trying to work in the same file simultaneously.\n",

    "### B. Modules are Objects\n",

    "import frc1318_data\n",

    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "We are now ready to talk about the differences between Python files and modules. A Python file is just a text file on your hard drive that contains Python code. As far as your operating system is concerned, it's no different than any other text file. Now take a close look at `frc1318_data` in the code snippet above. Do you see how `frc1318_data` behaves like an object? It has attributes (`team_name` and `city`) and methods (`get_current_roster()`) just like other objects we've seen. It behaves like an object because *it is an object*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, when we ran the code `import misc`, Python found the file *misc.py*, ran all of the code in that file, and created an object of type *module* named `misc`. To see for yourself, add the line `print(type(misc))` to the end of *mod_test.py* and re-run the program. A Python module is an object that is created from a Python file and is stored in memory. Module objects can be used directly within Python programs. In summary, modules and Python files are similar in the sense that a Python module is usually created from a corresponding Python file. Nevertheless they are different. When we refer to Python files, we're referring to text files, usually with a `.py` suffix, that are stored on your hard drive. When we refer to modules, we are referring to a Python object that is created from a Python file and is stored in your computer's memory. \n",
    "\n",
    "### C. Namespaces\n",
    "Also, did you notice how using modules allowed us to have two different functions both named `echo`? This is a useful feature of modules. Suppose you and another student decide to write a Python program. If you were to store all of your Python code in one file, you would have to work out some system to avoid duplicate names for variables or functions. But if you both keep your code in separate modules, then it doesn't matter if you use duplicate names. Every Python module has it's own **namespace**. A *namespace* is a set of names for various Python objects. One set of names (i.e., namespace) is defined within `misc.py` and another set is defined within `mod_test.py`. The concept of a *namespace* occurs in many programming languages."

    "1. You have to list every variable and function that you want to use in the `import` statement. This can be tedious.\n",
    "2. When you come across one of these imported items in the code, like `team_name` or `city`, it's not obvious that they were imported.\n",
    "3. You can't use items with the same names in your code. In the example above, if you were to forget you imported a variable called `city` and create another copy of it, your program might not do what you want.\n",

    "We can run `add.py` from the command line like this: `python add.py 25 37`. Since we're running `add.py` from the command line, `__name__ == \"__main__\"` will evaluate to `True` and the code in the `if` statement will extract the command line arguments, convert them to integers, and call the `add()` function. On the other hand, if we import `add.py` into another module, `__name__` will be set to \"add\", the `if` statement will evaluate to `False`, and the print statement will be ignored. This practice allows us to create Python modules that can be imported or run from the command line."
