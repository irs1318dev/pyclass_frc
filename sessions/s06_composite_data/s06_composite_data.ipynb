    "### I. Composite Types vs. Scalars\n",
    "This session will focus on composite data types. You have already been introduced to one composite data type, the list. Lists are considered to be composite data types because they contains several different items, each of which can be accessed individually. For example:\n",
    "```Python\n",
    "my_list = [1, 5, 9, 37]\n",
    "my_list[2]\n",
    "```\n",
    "In the example, `my_list` contains four different integers (*n = 4*), any one of which can be extracted from the list with the notation `my_list[x]` where *x* is an integer ranging from 0 to *n-1*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Integers, floats, and Booleans are not composite types because they cannot be broken up into smaller parts. Integers, floats, and Booleans are scalar data types, or they can also be called primitive values.\n",
    "\n",
    "What about strings? Are they composite data types ore scalars? That is an interesting question and we'll return to it later."

    "It's actually not correct to use the work *name* in relation to dictionaries - we're using the term now just for explanatory purposes. The correct term for *name* is *key*.
