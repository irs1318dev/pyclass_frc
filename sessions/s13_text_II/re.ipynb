    "In the preceding session we studied string literals, escape sequences, string formatting, encoding, string slicing, and string methods. While a programmer can get a lot of work done with these techniques, they only go so far. If you wanted to search a block of text chemical formulas or email addresses, you probably would need to write custom functions, and these custom functions would be difficult to debug.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this session we'll study a text processing tool called *regular expressions*. Regular expressions can complete sophisticated text processing jobs, like identfying email address or chemical formulas, in just a few lines of code. It takes some effort to learn regular expressions, but they are available in most programming languages. Once you learn them you can use them anywhere!\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we'll cover some of the text processing tools that are available in the Pandas package. It's pretty common to have a text column in a dataframe and to need to conduct some sort of transformation or evaluation of that column."
