A single digit in binary, either a 0 or a 1, is physically manifested in RAM with a transistor and a capacitor. When the capacitor is charged up, that means the memory cell is storing a 1. If the capacitor is discharged, that means the memory cell is storing a zero. This is an over-simplification, but it's still a useful mental model.\n",

    "#### Octal\n",
    "Octal refers to a numbering system that uses only the digits 0 through 7 (base 8). Counting to ten in octal looks like this: 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 10, 11, 12 (if you see an 8 or a 9 digit, you know it's not octal). Octal was commonly used in the 1960s because 6-bit, 12-bit, 24-bit, and 36-bit architectures were common. When we say a computer uses an n-bit architecture, we're saying that the computer's processor is able to store and manipulate n-bit numbers. So if we say a computer has a 12-bit architecture, for example, we're saying that the processor can store, add, divide, multiply, save to memory, and do other operations on 12-bit chunks of data. If the 12-bit chunk of data were to represent an integer, then the processor would be able to handle unsigned integers up to $2^{12} - 1$, or up to 4095. Octal numbers require three bits per digit, so octal representations worked well for these architectures, which all use multiples of three bits.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since the 1960s, architectures that use multiples of eight bits became commonplace. Consequently octal numbers are not frequently used. Nevertheless, Python can work with octal numbers. "

    "Some form of text encoding has been around since the middle of the 19th century, due to Samuel Morse's invention of the telegraph. One of the first applications of electrical engineering was to build machines that could automate transmission of messages by Morse code, and these machines needed to convert text to and from binary formats. These machines evolved into teletypes (also called teleprinters), which are machines that can send textual information via a phone line or other electrical connections. An early teletype from 1855 is pictured below.\n",

    "By the 1980s, even though ASCII requires only 7-bits to encode a character, most computers used a full byte to store each character. Computer and software companies could have just set the first, most significant bit to 0, but instead they added another 128 characters and created an 8-bit encoding scheme. The first 128 characters were identical to ASCII, with a zero in the most significant bit, and the new characters all had a one in the most significant bit. The most common 8-bit encoding scheme is CP1252. Microsoft created the CP1252 encoding scheme for the first version of Microsoft Windows, which was released in 1985. CP1252 added additional characters for other Western European languages, like æ and ü. CP1252 can be used for Danish, Finnish, French, Norwegian, Portuguese, and many other languages. You might also come across an encoding called ISO 8859-1, which is almost identical to CP1252.\n",

    "#### The Unicode Standard\n",
    "There are a whole lot of people in the world that speak languages that cannot be represented with ASCII, CP1252, or ISO 8859-1. Wouldn't it be great if there was one text encoding scheme that could handle all of the world's languages? We're in luck! The Unicode standard, which was released in the early 1990s, allows up to 1,114,111 different characters and symbols to be encoded. That's enough to cover all of the European languages including Greek and Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Devanagari, and much more. Currently, only 143,696 of the possible characters and symbols have been defined. Each character has been mapped to a different code point (i.e., integer). Conveniently the characters corresponding to the code points 0 through 127 are the same for ASCII and Unicode, so ASCII text can be read as Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 (but not Python 2) is fully compatible with Unicode. Use the `\"\\uxxxx\"` escape sequence in a literal string, where `xxxx` is the Unicode code point in hexadecimal notation that corresponds to the desired character. For code points with more than four hexadecimal digits, use the `\\Uxxxxxxxx` escape sequence. All four or all eight digits must be specified in the escape sequence, so add zeros to the front of the number as needed. All Unicode characters have string names, so you can also print the character with the escape sequence `\\N{character name}`. Here are some examples:"

    "#### Unicode Encodings: UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32\n",
    "Technically Unicode is not an encoding, it's an abstract encoding standard. It maps characters to code points but it does not specify how the integers should be represented as bytes. UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are encoding standards that specify a binary encoding for each Unicode code point. UTF-8 is by far the most frequently used and is a good encoding standard to use by default. It's a variable-length standard that generally uses one, two, three, or four bytes to represent a character (but uses more in some situations). UTF-16 is similar to UTF-8, but it uses between two and four bytes to encode a character. UTF-32 generally uses four bytes for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if UTF-8 can use different numbers of bytes to represent a single character, how does Python or any other software know where one character stops and the next character begins within a stream of bytes? It's actually quite simple. The first few bits of the first byte specify how many bytes are used. The following table shows the number of bytes used for specific ranges of code points. The table also shows the bit-by-bit structure of each byte. Bits represented with a 1 or a 0 are always a 1 or a 0 respectively. Bits represented with an x can be either a 1 or a 0.\n",

As we discussed way back in session 1, one can extract sub-strings using integer indexes, similar to how elements are extracted from lists. In Python, a set of start, stop and step indices that are joined with a colon (e.g., `27:20:-1`) is called a slice."

Microsoft Windows, on the other hand, uses two characters, a carriage return character ('\\r') and a line feed character ('\\n') to mark the end of a line. That's why, when you push files to a Github repository from Windows, you see all those messages about the end of line characters on the screen. Git is automatically converting your text files from using Windows style \"\\r\\n\" newline sequences with Linux style \"\\n\" newline characters. And if that's not confusing enough, old Apple Macintosh operating systems used just a carriage return to mark the end of a line.\n",

The print head would move left to right across the page and the paper would be moved up and down by the roller. To start typing a new line, the user would hit the *RE-TURN* key to move the print head back to the left side of the page, and the *LINE FEED* key to move the paper up one row, effectively moving the print head down to the next line.
