    "Tabular data is data that is organized into rows and columns. It's everywhere -- in newspapers and magazines, on websites, in computer databases, and in Microsoft Excel files. Evaluating and manipulating tabular data is an essential skill for any analyst.\n",

    "Tabular data is often stored in comma separated value (CSV) files. CSV files are text files that use commas and newline characters (I'll explain what those are shortly) to organize the contents of the file into a table. Let's look at an example. The `space.csv` file contains information on 4,324 space launches, starting with the launch of the the Sputnik spacecraft by the Soviet Union in 1957. The dataset is available on the [Kaggle website](https://www.kaggle.com/agirlcoding/all-space-missions-from-1957). The Python code below opens the file and displays the first five lines."

Microsoft Windows, on the other hand, uses two characters, a carriage return character ('\\r') and a line feed character ('\\n') to mark the end of a line. That's why, when you push files to a Github repository from Windows, you see all those messages about the end of line characters on the screen. Git is automatically converting your text files from using Windows style \"\\r\\n\" newline sequences with Linux style \"\\n\" newline characters. And if that's not confusing enough, old Apple Macintosh operating systems used just a carriage return to mark the end of a line.\n",

For example, suppose we're conducting a study on family income over time. We might collect multiple pieces of data on each family, such as income, number of children, education level of parents, age of parents, whether they own their home, etc. If we collect such information on 500 families, and then update the information every year for five years, we have panel data."
