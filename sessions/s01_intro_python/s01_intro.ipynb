Notebooks are a special kind of document that can include descriptive text (like the sentence you are reading right now), graphics, and Python code. Notebooks are useful because you can run the Python code and inspect its output directly in the notebook.\n",

If you are feel confident with respect to your computer skills (or you're just feeling lucky), then you can skip ahead to session 04 and set up Python on your computer.

Both *SHIFT + ENTER* and *CTRL + ENTER* will run the code cell that the cursor is in. *SHIFT + ENTER* will run the cell and select the next cell down (or create a new empty code cell if you ran the last cell in the notebook). *SHIFT + ENTER* is handy if you want to run a sequence of cells in order. *CTRL + ENTER* will also run the cell, but the cursor will not move the next cell -- the cell you just ran will stay selected. *CTRL + ENTER* is useful if you want to run the same cell repeatedly.\n",
    "7. You can also run a cell by pressing *ALT + ENTER*. Pressing *ALT + ENTER* will always insert a new empty cell after the cell you just ran.\n",
    "8. Finally, in Jupyter you can run a cell by clicking on the *Run* button in the toolbar, or by selecting *Cell -> Run Cells* from the menu. In Colab you can run a cell by clicking on the run button to the left of the cell (looks like a *Play* button)."

We also calculated that there are 24 different ways to order four cards. That means that for every combination of four cards, there are 24 permutations. So to calculate the number of combinations, we just have to divide the number of permutations by 24, the number of ways there are to order four cards."
