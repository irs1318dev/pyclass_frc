    "Later on we'll cover how to write Python programs that you can run by double clicking an icon or from a command line, but for our first few class sessions we'll run Python code directly in this document, which is called a **Jupyter notebook**. Jupyter notebooks are a special kind of document that can include descriptive text (like the sentence you are reading right now), graphics, and Python code. Jupyter notebooks are useful because you can run the Python code and inspect its output directly in the notebook.\n",

We're using *mybinder.org* for two reasons.\n",

    "  2. It's free.\n",

    "The *mybinder.org* website does have some drawbacks. It takes a long time (30 seconds or so) to load the Jupyter notebook and it can lock up if you leave the page alone for several minutes. If it locks up, reload the page by clicking on the hyperlink or bookmark that you used to initially load the page. (Hitting your browser's reload button won't work.) [Session 04](../../sessions/s04_tools/s04_tools.ipynb) will walk you through the process of installing Python and downloading all of the *FRC Analytics with Python* course materials to your own computer. If you are feel confident with respect to your computer skills (or you're just feeling lucky!), then you can skip ahead to session 04 and set up Python on your computer. Everything will run much better on your own computer. \n",

We also calculated that there are 24 different ways to order four cards. That means that for every combination of four cards, there are 24 permutations. So to calculate the number of combinations, we just have to divide the number of permutations by 24, the number of ways there are to order four cards."
