Initial development of HTTP was conducted by [Tim Berners-Lee](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Berners-Lee) in 1989 while he was a research fellow at the *European Organization for Nuclear Research*, better known as CERN (*Conseil européen pour la recherche nucléaire*).\n",

    "* POP3, SMTP, and IMAP are used for email.\n",

I navigate to their search page at `http://kcls.org/catalog/search` and type `asimov` into the author field and `robot` into the title field. The web browser will send an HTTP request message to the library's web server. The request message could look something like this:\n",

A code in the 400 range indicates there was an error with the request (like 404, *Not Found*) and a code in the 500 range means the request was valid, but the server had an error.
