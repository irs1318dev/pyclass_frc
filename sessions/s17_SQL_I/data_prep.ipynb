    "# FRC Analytics with Python - Session 16\n",
    "# Structured Query Language (SQL)\n",
    "**Last Updated: 8 October 2021**\n",
    "\n",
    "This session covers *Structured Query Language* (SQL). SQL is used to to create, modify, and retrieve data stored in relational databases. SQL has been in general use since the 1980s and is required knowledge for data scientists and business analysts. SQL is included in our curriculum because the Issaquah Robotics Society's scouting system uses SQL to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *database* is a software program that stores information. Relational databases are a type of database that store data in tables with rows and columns. Databases often run on computer servers and provide information to other computer programs over a network. For example, when a web browser retrieves a web page, the web page is generated by a web server like Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), or Nginx. Web servers typically retrieve data from relational database servers when they construct a web page. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle are some of the most common relational database servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IRS's scouting system uses a simple relational database called *Sqlite*. Sqlite is bundeled with Python, so if you've installed Python on your computer, you already have Sqlite."

Literal text values should always be surrounded by *single* quotes. (*Sqlite* will let you use double quotes around literal strings, but other common database servers, like *Postgres*, will not. It's best get in the habit of using single quotes in this situation.)\n",

For example, if we change our the second part of our `WHERE` clause to `AND city = 'seattle'`, our search will return no results (try it for yourself!) because all occurrences of 'Seattle' in the *teams* table are capitalized. *Sqlite* queries can be forced to conduct a case-insensitive search by adding `COLLATE NOCASE` to the end of the `WHERE` clause.
