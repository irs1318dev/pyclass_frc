    "# FRC Analytics with Python - Session 17\n",
    "# Introduction to Structured Query Language (SQL) - Part I\n",
    "**Last Updated: 17 October 2021**\n",
    "\n",
    "This session covers *Structured Query Language* (SQL). SQL is used to to create, modify, and retrieve data stored in relational databases. SQL has been in general use since the 1980s and is required knowledge for data scientists and business analysts. SQL is included in our curriculum because the Issaquah Robotics Society's scouting system uses SQL to store, retrieve, and manipulate data.\n",
    "\n",
    "A *database* is a software program that stores information. Relational databases are a type of database that store data in tables with rows and columns. Databases often run on computer servers and provide information to other computer programs over a network. For example, when a web browser retrieves a web page, the web page is generated by a web server like Apache, Microsoft Internet Information Services (IIS), or Nginx. Web servers typically retrieve data  needed to construct web pages from relational database servers. MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle are some of the most common relational database servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The IRS's scouting system uses a simple relational database called *SQLite*. Sqlite is bundeled with Python, so if you've installed Python on your computer, you already have SQLite.\n",
    "\n",
    "### SQL References\n",
    "There are many high-quality SQL references on the internet. This tutorial will refer to the following three references when appropriate.\n",
    "* The [W3 Schools SQL Tutorial](https://www.w3schools.com/Sql/default.asp)  The W3 tutorial covers basic SQL syntax that is common to popular database systems.  It includes simple examples and it's great for when you know what type of query you need but can't remember the exact syntax. This notebook contains links to applicable sections of the W3 SQL tutoral.\n",
    "* Although basic SQL syntax is the same on different database systems, there are differences in how they support advanced SQL features. [The official SQLite documentation](https://www.sqlite.org/lang.html) provides precise descriptions of the features supported by SQLite.\n",
    "* This notebook uses the *sqlite3* package from the *Python Standard Library* to interact with SQLite databases.  [The package's documenetation is available here.](https://docs.python.org/3/library/sqlite3.html) Keep in mind that SQLite can be used with many programming langauges, including Java, Python, C/C++, R, Javascript, Scala, Julia, and Ruby. Each of these languages has its own library for interacting with SQLite databases."

    "### G. SQL Syntax and Style\n",
    "Unlike Python, SQL is case insensitive. SQL considers the queries `SELECT * FROM teams;` and `select * frOM TEAMS;` to be identical. This means you can't have two tables where the only differences in the table names are that some characters are upper or lower case.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make our queries easy to read and understand, we will conform to a few style rules. These style rules come from a [SQL styleguide by Simon Holywell](https://www.sqlstyle.guide/). \n",
    "* SQL keywords like `SELECT` and `FROM` will always be all uppercase.\n",
    "* User-generated table and column names will always be all lowercase.\n",
    "* If table or column names contain multiple words, the words will be separated by underscores.\n",
    "* Longer queries will be placed on multiple lines, with the leftmost keywords right-aligned.\n",
    "* Table names will be a plural noun that describes the data stored in the table.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition, when writing SQL queries in Python code, the mentor recommends placing SQL queries in triple-quoted strings. This practice has two advantages:\n",
    "* It allows multi-line queries, which enhances readability.\n",
    "* Double quotes (`\"`) and single quotes (`'`) occur frequently in SQL queries. Single and double quotes can easily be placed in single-quoted strings.\n",

    "## III. Running Queries\n",
    "This notebook uses two different techniques to run SQL queries.\n",
    "* The `pandas.read_sql_query()` function\n",
    "* The SQLite command line interface (CLI)\n",
    "\n",
    "We've already seen examples of the `pandas.read_sql_query()` function. We'll use the SQLite CLI later in this section. There are other ways to run SQL queries that will be covered in the next session.\n",
    "\n",
    "### A. The `pandas.read_sql_query()` Function\n",
    "We've used the `read_sql_query()` function from the Pandas package to execute all of our queries. The `read_sql_query()` function is not part of the SQL specification. It is a function provided by the Pandas package that makes it easy to get data from a SQL database into a dataframe. We're using `read_sql_query()` function in this notebook because it's easy, which allows us to focus on learning SQL syntax. Also, it makes the query output look nice.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Helpful Hint:** *Pandas* SQL functions require that the *SQLAlchemy* package be installed. Installing Pandas does not automatically install *SQLAlchemy*. If you get an error the first time you run a Pandas SQL function, install SQLAlchemy if it isn't installed. The CLI commands `conda list sqlachemy` and `conda install sqlalchemy` should do the trick.\n",
    "\n",
    "The `read_sql_query()` function has two required parameters and six optional ones. We've used three of the parameters so far.\n",
    "* `sql`: A text string containing the SQL query we want to execute.\n",
    "* `con`: A SQLite database connection object. Without the connection object, Pandas would have no clue which database we want to use.\n",
    "* `index_col`: Pandas dataframes always have an index column that is displayed on the left side of the dataframe. If the use doesn't specify an index, Pandas will create an integer index starting at zero. The `index_col` parameter allows us to tell Pandas to use one of the table's columns as an index. This prevents Pandas from displaying an extraneous column of integers that don't exist in the underlying database.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Refer to the official Pandas documentation for more information on the `read_sql_query()` function.](https://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/reference/api/pandas.read_sql_query.html#pandas.read_sql_query).\n"

    "### B. SQLite on the Command Line\n",
    "The Pandas and sqlite3 packages are essential if we want to interact with a database from a Python program or a Jupyter notebook. But sometimes we just want to quickly check something in the database, for which writing Python code would be overkill. Fortunately, SQLite provides an easy command line tool, the SQLite Command Line Interface (CLI). Here is an example of a command that can be run in PowerShell, Mac Terminal, or Linux Bash.

    "In what order are database records returned if there is no `ORDER BY` clause? The official answer is that the order is *undefined*. In practice, relational databases often return records in the order they were created. For example, the order of records in our *wasno2020.sqlite3* database matches the order of the Pandas dataframes that the tables were created from. But that could change at any time, especially if the sqlite software is updated. Don't rely on the database's natural, undefined sort order. If order matters at all (and it ususally does), use an `ORDER BY` clause."
