A single digit in binary, either a 0 or a 1, is physically manifested in RAM with a transistor and a capacitor. When the capacitor is charged up, that means the memory cell is storing a 1. If the capacitor is discharged, that means the memory cell is storing a zero. This is an over-simplification, but it's still a useful mental model.\n",

Octal was commonly used in the 1960s because 6-bit, 12-bit, 24-bit, and 36-bit architectures were common. When we say a computer uses an n-bit architecture, we're saying that the computer's processor is able to store and manipulate n-bit numbers. So if we say a computer has a 12-bit architecture, for example, we're saying that the processor can store, add, divide, multiply, save to memory, and do other operations on 12-bit chunks of data. If the 12-bit chunk of data were to represent an integer, then the processor would be able to handle unsigned integers up to $2^{12} - 1$, or up to 4095. Octal numbers require three bits per digit, so octal representations worked well for these architectures, which all use multiples of three bits.\n",

So why didn't the creators of ASCII just use eight bits for their encoding scheme? There are a couple likely reasons:\n",
    "* Back in the 1960s, communications bandwidth was a minuscule fraction of what it is now. Encoding characters in 8-bit integers would have required more time to send a message between two locations.\n",

    "### C. 8-Bit Encodings\n",
    "By the 1980s, even though ASCII requires only 7-bits to encode a character, most computers used a full byte to store each character. Computer and software companies could have just set the first, most significant bit to 0, but instead they added another 128 characters and created an 8-bit encoding scheme. The first 128 characters were identical to ASCII, with a zero in the most significant bit, and the new characters all had a one in the most significant bit. The most common 8-bit encoding scheme is CP1252. Microsoft created the CP1252 encoding scheme for the first version of Microsoft Windows, which was released in 1985. CP1252 added additional characters for other Western European languages, like æ and ü. CP1252 can be used for Danish, Finnish, French, Norwegian, Portuguese, and many other languages. You might also come across an encoding called ISO 8859-1, which is almost identical to CP1252.\n",

    "#### The Unicode Standard\n",
    "There are a whole lot of people in the world that speak languages that cannot be represented with ASCII, CP1252, or ISO 8859-1. Wouldn't it be great if there was one text encoding scheme that could handle all of the world's languages? We're in luck! The Unicode standard, which was released in the early 1990s, allows up to 1,114,111 different characters and symbols to be encoded. That's enough to cover all of the European languages including Greek and Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Korean, Devanagari, and much more. Currently, only 143,696 of the possible characters and symbols have been defined. Each character has been mapped to a different code point (i.e., integer). Conveniently the characters corresponding to the code points 0 through 127 are the same for ASCII and Unicode, so ASCII text can be read as Unicode.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python 3 (but not Python 2) is fully compatible with Unicode. Use the `\"\\uxxxx\"` escape sequence in a literal string, where `xxxx` is the Unicode code point in hexadecimal notation that corresponds to the desired character. For code points with more than four hexadecimal digits, use the `\\Uxxxxxxxx` escape sequence. All four or all eight digits must be specified in the escape sequence, so add zeros to the front of the number as needed. All Unicode characters have string names, so you can also print the character with the escape sequence `\\N{character name}`. Here are some examples:"

    "Technically Unicode is not an encoding, it's an abstract encoding standard. It maps characters to code points but it does not specify how the integers should be represented as bytes. UTF-8, UTF-16, and UTF-32 are encoding standards that specify a binary encoding for each Unicode code point. UTF-8 is by far the most frequently used and is a good encoding standard to use by default. It's a variable-length standard that generally uses one, two, three, or four bytes to represent a character (but uses more in some situations). UTF-16 is similar to UTF-8, but it uses between two and four bytes to encode a character. UTF-32 generally uses four bytes for each character.\n",
    "\n",
    "So if UTF-8 can use different numbers of bytes to represent a single character, how does Python or any other software know where one character stops and the next character begins within a stream of bytes? It's actually quite simple. The first few bits of the first byte specify how many bytes are used. The following table shows the number of bytes used for specific ranges of code points. The table also shows the bit-by-bit structure of each byte. Bits represented with a 1 or a 0 are always a 1 or a 0 respectively. Bits represented with an x can be either a 1 or a 0.\n",
