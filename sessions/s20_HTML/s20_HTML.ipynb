    "# FRC Analytics with Python - Session 20\n",
    "# Introduction to HTML and the Web\n",
    "**Last Updated: 7 December 2021**\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why a Python class covers Hypertext Markup Langauge (HTML). The obvious reason for studying HTML is that our FRC team's robot analytics application depends on it. Students enter data into a webpage within a web browser that is processed and summarized by the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more important reason for learning HTML. Even the most profound data analysis is of little use if it cannot be shared. HTML and the related technologies of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Javascript are essential for sharing information with the Internet. The next few sessions will show you how to create and webpages and how to host them so they are publicly accessible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The instructional techniques in this session are different than the techniques used in prior sessions. You are proficient in Python. This means you can learn more on your own. This notebook will direct you to an excellent tutorial on HTML and will give you some exercises to complete so you can be confident that you understand and can apply the material."

    "You will need a programmer's text editor for writing HTML. *Visual Studio Code*, which you probably have been using to write Python programs, is an excellent text editor for HTML. If you create a new file and save it with a `.html` extension, VS Code will recognize that it's an HTML file and provide HTML syntax highlighting and code completion. There are many other suitable text editors, such as *Atom*, *Sublime Text*, and *Notepad++*. You can use whichever one you prefer.\n",

    "            <li>Position Control: 20</li>\n",
    "        </ul>  \n",
    "```\n",
    "#### Example CSS Rules\n",
    "```css\n",
    "h3                  {text-decoration: underline;}\n",
    ".autonomous         {color: blue;}\n",
    ".teleop             {color: red;}\n",
    "#auto-points-list   {font-family: \"Courier New\";}\n",
    "#teleop-points-list {font-style: italic;}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `id` and `class` attributes are used to link CSS rules to HTML elements. Id attribute values should be unique within a webpage. No two elements should have the same id value. On the other hand, you can assign the same class attribute to as many elements as you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in Mozilla's *CSS Basics* page, CSS has special selectors for elements with `class` and `id` attributes. Placing a period at the beginning of a CSS selector selects all elements with that class, and placing a hash mark at the beginning of a selector selects the elment with the matching id value. In the preceding example, the CSS rules that use the `class` selector (.) will turn the `<h3` and `<ul>` elements with autonomous data blue, and `<h3` and `<ul>` elements with teleop data red. Each CSS rule that uses an `id` selector (#) will affect a single HTML element.\n",
