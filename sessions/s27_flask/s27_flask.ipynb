    "# Flask - Serving Dynamic Websites\n",
    "**Last Updated: 30 December 2021**\n",
    "\n",
    "# I. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "We have spent many sessions learning about Web technologies. So far, our study of the Web has been from the persepective of the web browser, i.e., the client. In this session we will learn how to set up and run a web server, which is the program that generates the webpage and sends it to the client. Specifically, we are going to lean how to use a web server to generate a dynamic website.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code in this session will not work on Google Colab. This session must be completed on your own computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "## A. Static vs. Dynamic Websites\n",
    "\n",
    "To understand web servers, we need to understand the difference between static and dynamic websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "The webpages that we've hosted on Github are examples of static websites. We uploaded HTML, CSS, Javascript, and image files to our Github repository. When a user types the URL that corresponds to one of the HTML files in their browser's address bar, the Github web server reads the HTML file from disk and sends its content to the user's browser. The Github web server will also provide any other files that are referenced in the HTML file. The website is *static* because the content of each file is provided unaltered. The web server reads the file from disk and sends the data &mdash; that's all.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now consider Amazon's website. According to Google, Amazon sells more than 12 million different products. Did the web developers at Amazon create 12 million different HTML files? Of course not. All of the information about Amazon's products is stored in a a massive database. When a customer clicks on a link to view information about a product, Amazon's web server retrieves the product's information from the database and generates the webpage on the fly from the product data. This approach allows Amazon to add new products just by adding records to their product database. If the price changes, Amazon can update the price in the database and the webpage will be updated automatically. Websites that generate the web pages when the user requests them are called *dynamic* websites.\n",
    "\n",
    "This session covers a web framework for serving dynamic websites called *Flask*. Flask is an open-source framework that uses Python and works with several different web servers.\n",
    "\n",
    "## B. Installing Flask\n",
    "It's easy to install Flask with conda. Make sure you've activated the environment where you want to install flask, then run the following command.\n",

Keep in mind that the original URL, http://127.0.0.1:5000 still works.\n",
    "\n",
    "How does this all work? Let's step through it.\n",
    "1. `app = Flask(__name__)`\n",
    "  * The `Flask()` function returns a Flask application object. The Flask object has several properties and methods that are used for interacting with the Flask framework.\n",
    "  * Flask applications need to have a name. We set the name by passing it to the `Flask()` method as the first parameter . It's standard practice to set the application name to the name of the module that contains the application. The module name is available via [Python's built-in `__name__` variable](https://docs.python.org/3/library/__main__.html).\n",
    "2. `@app.route(\"/\")`\n",
    "  * This line specifies what happens when we enter a base URL like `http://127.0.0.1:5000` or `http://localhost:5000`. A base URL is a URL with no path, filename, or GET parameters. It's the part of a website's URL that is stays constant, regardless ow which page within the website the user navigates to. The parameter `\"/\"` is a shorthand for a base URL.\n",
    "  * Statements that precede a function definition and start with `@` are called decorators. A decorator is a function that accepts another function as an argument. Decorators are useful, but are tricky to understand. [The RealPython site has a good explanation of decorators](https://realpython.com/primer-on-python-decorators/), in case you want to understand them better.The `@` syntax is equivalent to the following snippet.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  ```python\n",
    "    from flask import Flask\n",
    "\n",
    "    app = Flask(__name__)\n",
    "\n",
    "    def hello_world():\n",
    "      return \"<p>Hello, World!</p>\"\n",
    "      \n",
    "    app.route(\"/\")(hello_world)\n",
    "  ```\n",
    "  * In summary, the `@app.route(\"/\")` statement directs Flask to run the `hello_world()` function whenever the server receives an HTTP request for the base URL.\n",
    "3. `def hello_world() ...`\n",
    "  * The `hello_world()` function is a Flask *view* function. View functions are called by the Flask framework and return text that will be sent to the client in an HTTP response.\n",
    "3. `@app.route(\"/first\") / def hello_first():`\n",
    "  * This section adds a new view function that responds to the URL `http://127.0.0.1:5000/first`.\n",
    "4. `@app.route(\"/<name>\") / def hello(name):`\n",
    "  * This section adds a view function that takes a parameter from the URL. Values passed to `route()` that are enclosed in angle brackets  (\"<\" and \">\") are treated as parameters. In this case, Flask takes the portion of the URL that comes after the forward slash (\"/\") and passes it to `hello()` as the `name` argument.\n",
    "5. `from markupsafe import escape` and `escape(name)`\n",
    "  * It's dangerous to insert user-supplied text directly into a web page. Malicious users might insert malicious JavaScript code into your web page. Read the [Flask tutorial on HTML Escaping](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/#html-escaping), which explains why this is a problem.\n",
    "  * The `escape` function, which is provided by the [markupsafe package](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/quickstart/#html-escaping), converts HTML and JavaScript code to text that cannot be executed in a browser.\n",
    "  \n",
    "The order in which view functions are defined matters. Flask will stop comparing URLs to view function routes as soon as it finds a match."

    "### C. The Loopback IP Address\n",
    "The URL that we're using to retrieve our Flask web pages, `http://127.0.0.1:5000`, looks different than the URLs we're used to. Instead of a domain names like *github.com* or *firstinspires.org*, our Flask URL uses 127.0.0.1. This series of integers and periods is an internet protocol (IP) address. The Internet uses IP addresses to identify the detination and origin of internet traffic.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you type a web address into your browsers address bar, your browser gets the IP address that corresponds to the domain name. It does this by sending a request to a special type of server that is called a DNS server. DNS stands for [domain name system](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain_Name_System). For example, as of 26 December 2021, the IP address for *github.com* is 140.82.114.4 and the IP address for *firstinspires.org* is 52.216.249.115. (You can look up IP addresses at https://domaintoipconverter.com/.)\n",
    "\n",
    "The IP address 127.0.0.1 is a special IP address called the *loopback address*. When you attempt to retrieve a webpage from the 127.0.0.1 IP address, your computur's operating system recognizes that the IP address is the loopback address and it doesn't let the HTTP request leave your computer. Instead, your operating system treats the HTTP request as if it's an *incoming* HTTP request from some other computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can use the domain *localhost* instead of 127.0.0.1 if desired. The URLs `http://127.0.0.1` and `http://localhost` are equivalent. The loopback address is useful for testing web servers during develoopment, because we don't need to know our computer's actual network IP address. Also, the default configuration of operating systems like macOS or Windows is to block incoming HTTP requests. Using *locahost* or 127.0.0.1 allows us to test a webserver without reconfiguring our operating system to allow incoming HTTP requests."

    "### D. Ports\n",
    "The other part of the URL that might look new is the string *:5000* that follows the IP address. The number 5000 is the *port* and the colon is used to separate the domain name or IP address from the port. The port is used to direct internet traffic to the right program on your computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "If you are working through this tutorial by running Jupyter on your local computer, then you are running two web servers simultaneously on your computer. Your browser is requesting web pages from the Jupyter server in one tab, and it is requesting web pages from the Flask server in another tab. The browser is sending both Jupyter and Flask requests to 127.0.0.1. How do we avoid mixing up the requests, i.e., sending Flask requests to the Jupyter server and vise-versa? We avoid mixing up requests by using different port numbers for our Jupyter and Flask servers. If you look at the address bar of this Jupyter notebook, you'll probably see that Jupyter is running on port 8888. Flask is running on port 5000. Using different port numbers allows your computer to avoid mixing up the Flask and Jupyter HTTP requests.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is an anology. Suppose HTTP packets are letters, and your computer is a house. The postal service is the Internet, and you have a butler named Wadsworth that represents your computer's operating system. There are several people living in your house. Their names are Chromia, Jupyter, Flaskbert, and Emailia. The residents don't speak to each other &#151; they communicate via letters that are delivered by Wadsworth. Wadsworth isn't a great butler because he has no clue who lives in the house, much less know their names. The rooms in the house are numbered and Chromia lives in room 80, Jupyter lives in room 8888, Flaskbert lives in room 5000, and Emailia lives in room 25.\n",
    "\n",
    "Chromia decides she needs some information from Flaskbert and from Jupyter. She writes two letters to request the information, one to Flaskbert and one to Jupyter. She's given up on getting Wadsworth to remember anyone's name, so she write Flaskbert's and Jupyter's room numbers on their respective envelopes. She also includes the code 127.0.0.1 on both envelopes and gives the letters to Wadsworth. Wadsworth knows that 127.0.0.1 means the recipients live in the same house, so he doesn't give the letters to the letter carrier. Instead, Wadsworth delivers the letters to their respective rooms and a little bit later he delivers the responses from Jupyter and Flaskbert back to room 80.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, Chromia decides she needs information from Wikipedius, who lives in a different house. She writes Wikipedius' house number (208.80.154.232) and room number (80) on the envelope. She also writes her own room number (80) in the return address, but she doesn't know her own house's address, so she leaves that off and gives the letter to Wadsworth. Wadsworth sees that the letter is addressed to someone in a different house, so he adds their house number (67.168.13.18) to the return address and gives the letter to the letter carrier. The letter carrier returns the next day with a response from Wikipedius, addressed to room 80 in house 67.168.13.18. Wadsworth delivers the response to room 80 and Chromia is satisfied.\n",
    "\n",
    "The letters to Flaskbert and Jupyter are like using *localhost* or *127.0.0.1* to request information from a server running on your own computer. The letter to *Wikipedius* is like requesting information from an external server. In both cases, port numbers are used to get the letters (HTTP traffic) to the right servers and clients. The purpose of the analogy is to illustrate how port numbers work, so it glosses over a lot of details. For example, Chromia normally would not remember Wikipedius's house number. She would have to request his house number from her friend **D**e**N**i**S**e.\n",
    "\n",
    "The default port number for traffic on the World Wide Web is 80. If you omit the port number from a URL in your browser, your browser assumes you meant to use port 80. That's why you don't see port numbers on most URLs."

    "\n",
    "But where did the `images` list come from? Look at the last line in *xkcd.py*. In the `render_template()` function, we passed the list of image file names to the function using a named argument, `images`. Named arguments that are passed to `render_template()` become variables within the Jinja template.\n",

The value starts and ends with double curly brackets, which tell Flask that the value is a Jinja expression that needs to be evaluated before the web page is sent to the client.\n",

    "The `url_for()` function is creating a URL that will link to each image in the `static/images/` subfolder. The full path is constructed with the expression `'static/images' ~ img`. The tilde, `~`, is a special Jinja operator that concatenates text, and the `img` variable contains a filename for a *.png* file that contains an XKCD comic. Remember, this expression is occuring within a Jinja *for* loop, which is looping over every element in the `images` list. Similar to a Python *for* loop, Jinja places the current element (i.e., a filename) from `images` into the `img` variable, which is defined in the *for* loop's opening statement."

Use Pandas's `.pivot()` method to convert the dataframe to a wide format, where there are two lines per match, with each team on the alliance displayed in a separate column. The columns containing the team numbers should be named \"Station 1\", \"Station 2\", and \"Station 3\", or something similar.
