Notebooks are a special kind of document that can include descriptive text (like the sentence you are reading right now), graphics, and Python code. Notebooks are useful because you can run the Python code and inspect its output directly in the notebook.\n",

If you are feel confident with respect to your computer skills (or you're just feeling lucky), then you can skip ahead to session 04 and set up Python on your computer.

We'll call this result [3, 9, 5, 7] (We'll drop the suits since they are all the same). Other possible results are [2, 10, 3, 8] or [5, 6, 3, 2]. Each of these possible outcomes is called a permutation. A question that comes up frequently in probability is \"How many possible permutations are there?\" Note that the order in which the cards are drawn matters. A result of [2, 3, 4, 5] is different than [5, 4, 3, 2].\n",
