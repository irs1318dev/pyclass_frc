# FRC Analytics with Python
This is an introductory Python programming course that was developed for
FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) students. The course focuses on using
Python for data analysis and visualization. This course was developed by
the Issaquah Robotics Society (IRS), FRC 1318 to prepare students to
maintain, operate, and extend the IRS's FRC scouting system.

## Course Objectives
Participants who complete this course will be able to:
* Create and run Python functions
* Organize Python code into classes
* Get data from external sources using HTTP and SQL
* Manipulate and analyze tabular data using Pandas, a powerful Python
  package for data analysis
* Evaluate data using descriptive statistics
* Create data visualizations using Bokeh, a Python package for creating
  charts and graphs
* Use Python for other scientific or engineering projects

## Necessary materials
* Laptop, preferably Windows 10 because thatâ€™s what the instructor uses,
  but any operating system should work
* No books needed - all necessary reference materials are online

## Course Delivery
* Course materials are presented via [Jupyter
  notebooks](http://jupyter.org) that are contained within the
  [irs1318dev/pyclass_frc Github repository]
  (https://github.com/irs1318dev/pyclass_frc).
* Notebooks for introductory sessions are hosted on mybinder.org, which
  allows students to get started with Python without having to install
  or configure any software on their computer.
* For more advanced sessions, students will clone the pyclass_frc
  repository to their local machine using git.
