    "# FRC Analytics with Python\n",
    "This is an introductory course in programming in Python that was developed for FIRST Robotics Competition (FRC) students. The course focuses on using Python for data analysis and visualization. This course was developed by the Issaquah Robotics Society (IRS), FRC 1318 to prepare students to maintain, operate, and extend the IRS's FRC scouting system."

    "* Create and run Python functions.\n",
    "* Organize Python code into classes.\n",
    "* Get data from external sources using HTTP and SQL.\n",
    "* Manipulate and analyze tabular data using Pandas, a powerful Python package for data analysis.\n",
    "* Evaluate data using descriptive statistics.\n",
    "* Create data visualizations using Bokeh, a Python package for creating charts and graphs.\n",
    "* Use Python for other scientific or engineering projects.\n",

    "* Open source and free to use.\n",
    "* Designed for readability.\n",
    "* Supports many different styles of programming, such as functional and object-oriented.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is an interpreted language\n",
    "* Interpreted means program code is not compiled.\n",
    "* Instead, text files with program code are read and executed by another program called the Python interpreter.\n",

    "Benefits of an interpreted language\n",
    "* Programs can be run on any operating system (e.g., Linux, Windows, Mac, etc.).\n",

The createor of Python, Guido van Rossum, is apparantly a fan of *Monty Python's Flying Circus*, which was a British sketch comedy TV series that ran from 1969 to 1974. The name reflects one of the goals of Python's developers - Python should be fun to use. [Here is a link to the instructors favorite sketch](https://youtu.be/xpAvcGcEc0k)."
