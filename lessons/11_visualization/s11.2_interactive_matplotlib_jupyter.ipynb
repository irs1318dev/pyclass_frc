    "5. Enable JupyterLab extensions. Hit CTRL+SHIFT+C to open the command window on the left (or click on the third icon down that looks like a list with a magnifying glass next to a list -- tooltype should say \"commands\"). Then find the Enable Extension Manager command (you can type extensions in the search bar). Click it to enable extensions then click Enable to confirm. Make sure Enable Extensions Manager command has a checkmark next to it.\n",
    "6. You should now see an icon on the left to of the Jupyter Lab window that looks like a puzzle piece. Click on that to go to the Extension Manager.\n",
