    "# FRC Analytics with Python - Session 20\n",
    "# Introduction to the Web\n",
    "**Last Updated: 7 December 2021**\n",
    "\n",
    "You might be wondering why a Python class includes topics related to the *World Wide Web*, like HTML, Javasript, and CSS. The obvious reason is that our FRC team's robot analytics application depends on web technologies. Our application uses Web technologies to generate user interfaces and share data between the different components of the application.\n",
    "\n",
    "There is a more important reason for learning Web technologies. Even the most profound data analysis is of little use if it cannot be shared. HTML and the related technologies of Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Javascript are essential for sharing information with the Internet. The next few sessions will show you how to create webpages and how to host them so they are publicly accessible. \n",
    "\n",
    "The instructional techniques in this session are different than the techniques used in prior sessions. You are proficient in Python. This means you can learn more on your own. This notebook will direct you to an excellent tutorial on the Web and will give you some exercises to complete so you can be confident that you understand and can apply the material."

If you create a new file and save it with a `.html` extension, VS Code will recognize that it's an HTML file and provide HTML syntax highlighting and code completion.

    "            <li>Position Control: 20</li>\n",
    "        </ul>  \n",

    "#### Example CSS Rules\n",
    "```css\n",
    "h3                  {text-decoration: underline;}\n",
    ".autonomous         {color: blue;}\n",
    ".teleop             {color: red;}\n",
    "#auto-points-list   {font-family: \"Courier New\";}\n",
    "#teleop-points-list {font-style: italic;}\n",
    "```\n",
    "The `id` and `class` attributes are used to link CSS rules to HTML elements. Id attribute values should be unique within a webpage. No two elements should have the same id value. On the other hand, you can assign the same class attribute to as many elements as you want. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned in Mozilla's *CSS Basics* page, CSS has special selectors for elements with `class` and `id` attributes. Placing a period at the beginning of a CSS selector selects all elements with that class, and placing a hash mark at the beginning of a selector selects the elment with the matching id value. In the preceding example, the CSS rules that use the `class` selector (.) will turn the `<h3` and `<ul>` elements with autonomous data blue, and `<h3` and `<ul>` elements with teleop data red. Each CSS rule that uses an `id` selector (#) will affect a single HTML element.\n",
