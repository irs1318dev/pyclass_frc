    "4. Line 5, `count -= 1`, is also indented, so Python executes that line too. the variable *count* is now equal to 9.\n",
    "5. Line 6 is not indented. Therefore it is not part of the *while* loop. Python ignores line 6 and goes back to the beginning of the loop in line 3.\n",
    "6. The *count* variable is now equal to 9, which is still greater than 0. Python executes the two statements within the loop, on lines 4 and 5, again.\n",
    "7. This cycle continues until *count* is equal to negative 1. Finally, the conditional expression on line 3 evaluates to `False`. Python will now ignore the body of the loop (the two indented lines) and proceed to line 6.\n",
    "8. Python executes line 6, displaying the liftoff string, and we're done.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Now let's try a couple things.**\n",
    "1. Insert 4 spaces in front of `print(...)` in line 6, so the statement has the same indentation level as lines 4 and 5. What do you think will happen if you re-run the loop? Run the loop and see if you were right.\n",
    "  * As you can see, the liftoff statement is now part of the *while* loop and runs during every iteration of the loop.  \n",
    "  \n",

    "2. Comment out line 5. This means you should place a hash mark, `#`, in front of the line so Python will ignore it. What do you think will happen if you run the cell? Run the cell and see if you were right.\n",
    "  * You have just placed Python in an infinite loop. You can tell that it's still running because of the asterisk to the left of the code cell. Stop Python by hitting the black square on the toolbar (next to *Run*). Or you can select *Kernal -> Interrupt* from the menu. Or you can press ESC and then press *I* twice.\n",
    "  * If you remove the decrement statement (line 5), the value in count never gets smaller. Every time Python finishes an iteration of the loop, goes back to the beginning, and checks `count >= 0`, count will always be greater than zero. I suppose that sometime over the next several billion years, it's possible that some gamma rays could hit your computer and flip the bits to a value less than zero, but I suspect you will have stopped paying your electricity bill by then, so the point is moot.\n",
    "  * I think it's a good practice, when writing a while loop, to write the decrement or increment statement first, before you write any other lines of code. That makes it a bit harder to get into an infinite loop."

We need to set `a` to be equal to the second term of the sequence. Fortunately, we saved the value of the second term earlier in the `swap` variable.\n",

In the previous two *while* loop examples, we had to manually increment a counting variable (`factor` in the *break* example and `num` in the *continue* example). We'll end up with an infinite loop if we forget to add this increment step. *For* loops can also be easier to understand.
